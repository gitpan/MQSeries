As you will quickly discover, this set of examples is a work in
progress.

I did not have time to get anything respectable together for the 1.06
release, but I hope to eventually have perl versions of all of IBM

The side by side comparison of the C vs. perl really shows how much
easier the perl API is to use.  But then, I'm biased...
